# myrestservices

I have created a small REST service using .NET .
 
I have created two endpoints:
1. Health check endpoint without authentication that return code 200 OK when service is loaded
2. User endpoint that returns random user from https://randomuser.me service. User endpoint is having basic authentication with login-password that are set through properties.
 
I have created simple webpage, with some unittest and added swagger ui for the same
